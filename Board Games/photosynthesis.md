## Preparation

1. Set the board with the sun on the Sun icon.
2. Each player has its own board for a type of tree.
3. Each player fills his board with trees and seeds:
    - 4 seeds
    - 4 small trees
    - 3 medium trees
    - 2 big trees
4. Each player sets its light counter to 0.
5. Trees and seeds that are left outside each player board are "available":
    - 2 seeds
    - 4 small trees
    - 1 medium tree
6. Organize the scores by leaf amount, ordering them in descending order.

## Setting Initial Trees

1. Each player, starting with the one that has the **first player token**,
places a small tree on one of the exterior places, the ones with 1 leaf.
2. Repeat the previous step once more, so that everybody has two small trees.

## Game Loop

Players take turns clockwise to perform the Photosynthesis and Action phases.

### Photosynthesis

- All trees that don't have a shadow cast on them generate light.
- Shadows are cast in the direction of the Sun,
spanning based on the size of the tree: 1 tile for small trees,
2 tiles for medium trees and 3 tiles for big trees.
- Your own trees cast shadows on your other trees.

### Actions

Players can do as many actions as they wish, as long as the same tile is not affected twice.

##### Plant Seed
- Costs 1 light.
- You can place an available seed on any empty tile at size distance (1, 2 or 3) from another of your trees.
- Both the seed and the tree from where it spawned are considered used, and no more actions can be done on them this turn.

#### Buy Tree or Seed
- Pay the cost for the lower tree or seed that you want to acquire.
- Place the tree or seed outside your board, to signal it is available.

#### Grow Tree or Seed
- Pay the appropriate cost and replace the tree or seed with its next growth tier.
- The tree or seed that is removed from the main board is returned to your personal board if there is space, from top to bottom.
Otherwise, remove it from game.

#### Cultivate
- Pay 4 light to remove a big tree from the main board and return it to your player board.
- Gain a score token corresponding to the amount of leaves of the tile.
- If no score token is available for the amount of leaves, get one from the next tier.

### Preparing for next turn
- Sun moves to the next position clockwise.
- First player token moves to the next player clockwise.

## End of game
- When the Sun completes its 3rd round, the game ends
- Sum your score tokens as the final score.
- Add remaining light / 3 rounded down to the final score.
- In case of a tie, the one with more trees and seeds wins.


## 2 Player variant

Only difference is that 4 leaves scores are removed from the game.

## Advanced Variants
- The Sun needs to complete 4 rounds for the game to end instead of 3.
- You can't grow trees or plant seeds while in shadows.
