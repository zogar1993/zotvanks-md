By no means are the Players expected to turn every situation upside-down. They are, however, welcome to use their Questions and Special Rules to influence each Scene in a matter they see fit and that resonates well with their Characters. In Defiant, it’s not the GM’s job to tailor the surroundings to the Characters - this responsibility falls on the Players.

Dont be afraid to openly communicate inner thoughts narratively. What this NPC said insults me and my house greatly. I make a fist with my hand and leave the room in a fit of rage, before he says something stupid and I end up breaking his jaw. Its better to be explicit about the inner workings of your character so that other players are more involved with you are going through than to be mysterious.

Players have some master capacity, both with questions and things that happen to their characters and courts.
