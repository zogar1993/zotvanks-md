## Tool for people who get out of character

Stress is a mechanic from Cruzader Kings 3, where the character will accumulate stress when doing things that don't fit his personality.

This can be used on TTRPGs to simulate acting out of character.
It's not that the dumb barbarian cant have an intelligent thought, or the aristocrat cant get dirty in the sewers,
but doing so is out of their element, and penalized.

Different systems have different mechanisms for doing so,
maybe mental peril or corruption on zweihander, healing surges on D&D,
or willpower in WoD, but it's a nice idea for mechanizing getting out of character
in a way that feels natural.
